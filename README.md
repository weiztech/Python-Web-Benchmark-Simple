# Python Web Framework Simple Benchmark

###### Test Python Webframework Async and Sync

## Simple Test Flow

- on server side, add 2 seconds sleep before return the response
- use `wrk` for testing the API: `wrk -t5 -c400 -d30s --timeout 3 http://localhost:8000/`
- the server will run using gunicorn with settings 1 worker, 1 threads, 3s timeout and for ASGI type will use `Uvicorn`.<br/>
  command: `gunicorn -w 1 --threads 1 --timeout 3 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`
- Tested on MBP - Processor i9 and RAM 16 GB

#### Flask (ASGI)

Using above gunicorn command with Uvicorn its not working, so I follow the [documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/asgi/) and use `Hypercorn`.<br/>
run server command: `hypercorn -w 1 app:asgi_app`
<br/>the result is quite suprising because it's the same as without using any ASGI (not quite sure what's wrong for this case) ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

## Conclusion

Python Web Framework with `ASGI` will have ability to handle more requests
